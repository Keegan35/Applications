    <string name="text_information">The point of the game is to match the pictures with the same pictures that are given under the question mark blocks. So, you click on one block and a picture will show up and then click on another block and another picture will show up. If the pictures donâ€™t match, then they will turn around again and if they do match then they will stay the way they are.</string>
